Trivia App - Brief

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content for all ages by developing an interactive trivia app that presents quizzes on a variety of topics. The user should be able to select from a variety of topics and view their score. Your task is to make a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to put forward to them - this may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.

MVP

A user should be able to:
Select from a variety of topics 
be able to answer through multiple choice and view results (including score and incorrect answers)
Record and display the userâ€™s scores even after the page refreshes. 

Example Extensions

Add multiplayer functionality.
Use charts to display user scores.
Automatically create new db collection for each user / set of users
Add a section for true / false quizzes instead of multiple choice

API, Libraries, Resources
